# NFT-Collection-IPFS

NFT Collection with metadata on IPFS

Deployed on the Mumbai testnet (general idea is to explain how value is created in web3, understanding that it's community driven)

### Structure

- PNG stored on IPFS
- Metadata (JSON) stored on IPFS
- NFT created from the smart-contract (Solidity)

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```
